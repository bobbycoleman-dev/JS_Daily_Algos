/* 
Amazon is developing a new song selection algorithm that will sync with the
duration of your bus ride.

Given a positive integer representing a duration of a bus ride and
an array of positive integers representing song times, find a pair of two songs
where the song pair ends 30 seconds before the bus ride ends.

return an array of the song indexes or [-1, -1] if no pair is found.

If there are multiple song pairs that match, return the pair that contains the
longest song. The order of the returned indexes doesn't matter.

/* Explanation:
There are multiple pairs that add up to 30 seconds before the bus duration.
The pair at indexes 4 and 6 is the pair with the longest song that is chosen.
